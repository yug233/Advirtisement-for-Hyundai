  <h3 align="center"> How a poor men build Hyundai.</h1>

<h4 align="left"> First attempt to escape poverty:</h6>
<p align="left"> One day he read in the newspaper. It said there was a big constructionin  a nearby city and it needsmore labourers. This motivated him to do something. In 1932, at the age of 16, he deicided to leave the city to go to the construction site. One night, Chung quietly left the city with his friend. He reachen Kowon after walking 160 kilometres and started working as a construction labourer. He worked so hard there but measly wages but he didn't care as he was able to earn independently for the first time in his life.
  
  Life continued like this for 2 months until is he got caught by his father. He had to back to farming. Though his relatives were happy to have him back but Chung wasn't. However these two months had ignited his passion for construction and civil engineering. He also realised he would never beat poverty by working in the feilds.  </p>

<h4 align="left"> Second attempt to escape poverty </h4>
<p align="left"> He decided to go to Keijo(now Seoul). With the help of his two friends, he again left the city in April 1933 to go to Keijo. But the journey seemed to be destined to faiure since one of the boys werre caught by a sibling earlier one which meant he couldn't come. More misfortune came as a con man promised them jobs but ended up stilling their money. The journey came to an end when Chung's dad found the two staying at there grandparents house nearby.</p>

<h4 align="left"> Third atttempt to escape poverty</h4>
<p align="left"> He found himself working in the feilds again for another year. Once his duties were complete he decided it was time for another escape. He managed to get a 
 70 won train ticket to Keijo by selling his fathers cow. He enrolled himself to a local bookeeping school hoping to start his carreer as an accountant. Things went smoothly for two months untill his father found him and took him back home.

 <h4 align="left"> Rice Merchant(Fourth escape attempt)</h4>
 <p align="left"> In 1933 at the age of 18, he decided to decided escape from his village for the fourth time with the help of his friend who tried to escape a forced marriage. This time there was no one stopping them. Once Chung reached the capital he tried to find any job he could find. First he worked as laborer at Jinsen Harbour(now Incheon, currently in South Korea),  then a construction worker at Boseong Proffessional School and  as a handyman at a starch syrup company. </p>

 <p align="left"> After working at the factory for nearly a year, he decided to be a delivery man for the Bokheung Rice Store. His new work offered him advancement and as he became better at it, he decided to be full time on it. He eventually won the praise of the stores core customeres which impressed the owner. After only being at the job for six months, the store owner allowed him to manage the store's accounting. Doing this helped him develop his buisness sense.</p>

 <p align="left"> One day the store owner became seriously ill and gave the store to Chung after the hard work he has put to the store. At 22, he became the store owner and renamed it to Kyungil Store Owner. The store went smoothly under his ownership- he grew the store and made good profits. But then in 1939, when Japan was in World war II it sercured rice supplies mostly to the millitary and country. This meant many rice stores closed including Chung's. But he wasn't done yet! </p>

 <h4 align="left"> A-do garage service</h4>
 <p align="left"> Chung wanted to own a buissness were the Japanesse government couldn't control. Thinking of this, he soon decided to be in the car repair buisness. So in 1940, Chung took a 3000 won loan and opened "A-Do Garage". But unfortunatly the garage had burned down in ashes a few days after opening. He had to pay of his loan and tell the owneres of the cars to compinsate. However he didn't give in this difficult situation and took another loan of 3500 won and built an even better garage. Chung realised that the biggest problem was how long it took for the customers to get there cars back. So his main focus was on speed where his competoitors took 20 days for a certain repair but Chung's garage service took 5 days. The business had been so successful that up until 1943 the garage service had up to 80 employees, was able to pay of his loan, and settled his family in Keijo.

Unfortunately tradegy stuck. The japaneese government decided to forcefully take owner ship of his garage and merge it to a steel plant nearby to make war related materials. This meant the Japaneese had taken his buisness for the second for war related reasons. He also was forced to return back to his village but this time with 50,000 won in savings.</p>

<h4 align="left"> Hyundai Auto Garage</h4> 
<p align="left"> After World War 2 ended in 1945, Japan lost ownership of Korea hence Korea was divided into North and South Korea. The North side of Korea was influenced by Soviet Union(modern day Russia.) and the South Side influenced by America. So he moved back to Keijo and started another auto service but this time called "Hyundai Auto Service" which Hyundai meaning "mordern." And the business went successful but that was when Chung had another buisness idea.</p>

<h4 align="left"> Hyundai Civil Works Company</h4>
<p align="left"> Chung saw that America was constructing buildings for it's millitary forces. He saw a big opportunity in the contruction buisness. Though he didn't have experience in construction but he still had that passion he had for construction that he had when he was a laborer.
So in 1947 he created the 'Hyundai Civil Works Company and officailly entered the construction buisness. Though he got small projects at first, he started to get big project by the 1950s. Everything thing went smoothly but then...
